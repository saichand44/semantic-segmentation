# semantic-segmentation
 
Project to use a deep learning algorithm that associates a label or category with every pixel in an image (semantic segmentation).

### Deep Learning Algorithm
ENet neural network architecture has been used due to its speed and small model size

### Dataset
The Cityscapes Dataset which contains 20 categories / classes and a different color is assigned to identify each class.
